TIC TAC TOE GAME

tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

To begin, each player decides which mark they will use. Players take turns placing their mark in an empty space in the 3×3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game. If all of the spaces on the board are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
